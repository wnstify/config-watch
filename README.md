# SSH Config Change Monitor

A Bash script to monitor changes in your SSH configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`) and send notifications for **added** or **removed** hosts via webhooks.

## Features

- **Monitor SSH Config File**: Watches the `~/.ssh/config` file for changes.
- **Detect Changes**: Identifies added and removed `Host` and `HostName` entries.
- **Webhook Integration**:
  - Sends notifications for added hosts to a designated webhook.
  - Sends notifications for removed hosts to a separate webhook.
- **State Management**: Maintains the last known state of the SSH config for accurate change detection.

---

## How It Works

1. The script parses the `~/.ssh/config` file and extracts `Host` and `HostName` pairs.
2. It compares the current state of the SSH config with the last known state stored in a temporary file.
3. Sends:
   - **Added Hosts**: To the webhook specified in the `WEBHOOK_ADDED` variable.
   - **Removed Hosts**: To the webhook specified in the `WEBHOOK_REMOVED` variable.
4. Updates the state file for future comparisons.

---

## Requirements

- **Bash**: Ensure Bash is installed on your system.
- **curl**: Required for sending webhook requests.

---

## Windows Compatibility

On Windows machines, you can use **Git Bash** to execute this script. Git Bash provides a Unix-like environment on Windows and supports tools like `bash`, `curl`, and `cron`.

### Steps:

1. **Install Git Bash**:
   - Download and install Git for Windows from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).
   - Open Git Bash from the Start Menu after installation.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing the script in Git Bash.
   - Execute the script using:
     ```bash
     ./update.sh
     ```

3. **Automate Execution**:
   - Use a cron-like scheduling tool in Git Bash to run the script periodically if needed:
     ```bash
     crontab -e
     ```
   - Add an entry to execute the script at your desired interval:
     ```bash
     */5 * * * * /path/to/update.sh
     ```

## Customization

- **Change State File Location**:
  Modify the `TEMP_STATE` variable to specify a different path for the state file.
  
- **Customize Webhook Payloads**:
  Adjust the `PAYLOAD` construction to include additional fields or modify the structure.
